  ## Introduction
  This ReadMe, and the associated scripts within this repository, were written for an assignment for a module in Programming for Data Analytics, as part of a Higher Diploma in Science (Data Analytics). The specific questions associated with each individual script are listed in the [Questions Asked](#Questions-Asked) section below. The overall answers are to be found in the Juppyter notebook (Numpy Assignment.ipynb), along with the associated scripts.
  
  ## Technologies and Libraries
  ### Main Platform
  * Python 3.7.2
  
  ### External libraries
  These are libraries that are not normally part of the standard installation with Python, and will need to be installed prior to running some of these scripts. The questions that the libraries are needed for is listed after the library name.
  * Matplotlib.pyplot
  * NumPy
  
  ## Setup
  
  In order to run the scripts in this repository, it is necessary to have a complier capable of compiling Python 3.7.2. In addition, it will be necessary to install the external libraries described above if there is a requirement to run Q10.
  
  All the codes in this repository have been tested using <a href="https://cmder.net/">Cmder</a>, with the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> being the default Python platform.  
  
  ## Research
  Two separate types of research were carried out in order to solve the problems posed. These were:
  
  * Problem solving research
    
  ### Problem solving research
  All research with regards to problem solving was treated as a thought exercise. As such, all problems, solutions, processes, and code logic was created from the author's own mind. As the problems are fairly common problems, in terms of processes, and logic, there may be some overlap between the logic shown in the author's solutions, and existing information available on the web.
  
  ## Questions Asked
  The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. The specific tasks are:

  1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
  2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
  3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
  4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
  
  ## Status
  The status of this project is complete. As there is a submission date of the 31st March, 2019, the files will be altered, from their current format, after that date. Where the last push/alter date is prior to the 31st March, 2019, that date can be viewed as the completion date.
